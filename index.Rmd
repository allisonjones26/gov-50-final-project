## Project thoughts

I am interested in exploring data related to types of Halloween candy and their popularity among consumers. In particular, I am curious to learn if Halloween candy containing nuts tends to be more popular than nut-free candy. The studyâ€™s findings might help consumers make informed choices when purchasing Halloween candy by ensuring consumers choose treats that are more likely to be enjoyed by trick-or-treaters.
